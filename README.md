# 🏨 Hotel Hunt

**Hotel Hunt** is a hotel browsing and booking website built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**.  
The goal of this project is to provide a modern, responsive, and user-friendly interface for exploring hotels and their details.
This is **my first project using React**, where I applied what I have learned in modern web development, including component-based architecture, responsive design, and deployment with Netlify.
